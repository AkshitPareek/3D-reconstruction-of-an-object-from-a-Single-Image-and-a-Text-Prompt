# 3D Reconstruction of an object from a Single Image and a Text Prompt

This project combines GroundingDINO, Segment Anything, ZoeDepth and Multiview Compressive Coding for 3D reconstruction to reconstruct 3D model of the prompted object from a single image.

## Installation

Clone Repositories.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AkshitPareek/3D-reconstruction-of-an-object-from-a-Single-Image-and-a-Text-Prompt.git

git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git

git clone https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO.git

git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/MCC.git
```

Download Checkpoints.

-   [GroundingDino checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/ShilongLiu/GroundingDINO/resolve/main/groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth)
-   [SAM checkpoint](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth)
-   [MCC checkpoint](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/MCC/co3dv2_all_categories.pth)

Place them in a new checkpoints/ folder.

```
mkdir checkpoints
```

Create a new conda environment.

```bash
conda create -n btp python=3.9

conda activate btp
```

Install pytorch3d dependencies:

```
conda install pytorch=1.13.1 torchvision=0.14.1 pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia 
conda install -c fvcore -c iopath -c conda-forge fvcore iopath

conda install jupyter 
pip install scikit-image matplotlib imageio plotly opencv-python

```

Build [pytorch3d](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d/blob/main/INSTALL.md#building--installing-from-source) from source.

Install other dependencies.

```bash
pip install h5py omegaconf submitit
```

```
pip install -e GroundingDINO 
pip install -e SegmentAnything
```

Add the conda environment to jupyter notebook:

```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=btp
```

**NOTE:** If pytorch3d gives import module error, choose your environment kernel in jupyter notebook

## Usage

To use this project, you need to put your input image in the input folder, and follow the steps on the [notebook](https://github.com/AkshitPareek/3D-reconstruction-of-an-object-from-a-Single-Image-and-a-Text-Prompt/blob/main/reconstruction.ipynb) to perform the reconstruction.

```bash
mkdir input
```
```
mkdir output
```
